    "## **1. Intro:**\n",
    "OpenProjection is a basic open-source machine learning project I designed during my master's. Its main use is as a very beginner-friendly, step-by-step tutorial for machine learning in Python. It covers different types of supervised learning problems, including both regression and classification, as well as an embedded unsupervised learning problem. The nature of the data used herein also means we'll be touching on aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), but won't go into excessive detail. We'll also practice using an API (remotely accessing some website's functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire thing can be run from start to finish in Google Colab [here](), with an accopmanying video walkthrough [here](). On the other hand, the entire script is also available if you wanna just jump right in. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Context:** \n",
    "It is said that we do not perceive the world as it is, but as we are. Such poetic truisms capture a key phenomenon that the fields of philosophy, psychology and neurosicence have been grappling with for millenia, centuries and decades, respectively: individuals experience themselves and the world in their own unique and rather impenetrable way. Getting to the core subjective experience holds great promise for many other herculean tasks, such as understanding, preventing and treating the distorsions of subjective experience that lead to mental health diagnoses and ultimately, revealing the nature of consciousness itself. Obviously, we won't be solving the Hard Problem in this notebook, but we will attempt a first pass at quantifying verbal reports of subjective experience and relating them to mental health (broadly construed).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with a classic test in psychology, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), designed to assess variations in how individuals interpret ambiguous situations. Following from the popular adage at the beginnning of this section, the TAT is founded on the idea that people reveal aspects of themselves when confronted with non-obvious situations. However, the degree to which this is true has never truly been exposed to quantitative statistical verification....until now. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, our goal is to turn TAT verbal reports into numeric variables and determine if they hold any significance/possess any predictive power. So, we'll first need some kind of algorithm that turns words into numbers, and we'll also need some target to predict which would validate whether our algorithm is useful or not. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Data:**\n",
    "Now we're ready to get our hands dirty, so to speak. Open TAT data has been graciously and freely provided by Middle Tennessee State Univeristy [here](https://jewlscholar.mtsu.edu/items/a54a5d18-3cfa-4700-bbf5-7d68a4375df3). To many, this step is the most crucial since machine learning does not learn out of thin air. The quality of our models depends on the quality of our training data. Or, more bluntly, \"gargabe in, garbage out\". \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1. Load and explore data**\n",
    "When taking a first look at fresh data, you'll want to know a couple of important things:\n",
    "* How many rows (observations) \n",
    "* How many columns (variables), and what kind of data they contain\n",
    "* If there are any missing values, as well as **how many** and **in which columns** they are if so\n"
